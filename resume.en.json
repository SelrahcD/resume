    "summary": "After several years at Evaneos, from its startup phase to scale-up, I decided to become independent.\n\nMy goal is to help teams reach their full potential, to produce software that continuously meets their users' true needs, while maintaining a sustainable pace.\n\n I truly believe that it is the combination of real problems, an appropriate organization, a well-thought-out product, and quality tech that creates value for users. I view myself as someone who connects the various skills of my clients' teams, opens the doors to other ideas, to help them create the best possible solutions.\n\nI do this by bringing a mix of technical and architectural skills, facilitation techniques, an interest for product management and an agile mindset.",
